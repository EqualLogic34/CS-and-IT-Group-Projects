# Cloneing a repo that is already created. 
## 1. Start by download git to use locally on your machine. https://git-scm.com/downloads
## 2. Download and install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
## 3. Use git clone to clone the repo onto your local machine. 
    On your github repo click on the green code button next choose how you want to clone. I always use  HTTPS
    on the right copy the url and go into your command prompt. 
## 4. In your command prompt go into whatever folder you wish to put the repo in, and type git clone (url of repo)
## 5. cd into your repo you just cloned and use command npm install. 
## 5. After npm install use npm start to run the react application. It should open a browser and you should see your start app there.
